Next set of things to do: 


-extract r2 values for each species for the abundance-detections graphs
(above to be plotted similar to Mikula's initial plot)

-plot r2 value vs. body mass
-plot r and r2 value on the phylogeny


-run PGLS? Need to think about what the PGLS is currently trying to model associations between.
