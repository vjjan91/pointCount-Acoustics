Next set of things to do: 
  
-plot r value from these approaches and predictors (body mass, migratory-non-migratory, frequency, and other trait level predictors that you can think of)
-plot r value on the phylogeny

-run PGLS? Need to think about what the PGLS is currently trying to model associations between.
