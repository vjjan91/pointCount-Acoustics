# Abundance vs. detections  

In this script, we test for correlations between abundance (as estimated from point count data) and detections (as estimated from acoustic data).  

## Install necessary libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(vegan)
library(ggplot2)
library(scico)
library(data.table)
library(extrafont)
library(ggstatsplot)
library(ggside)

# Source any custom/other internal functions necessary for analysis
source("code/01_internal-functions.R")
```

## Load dataframe containing point count and acoustic data
```{r}
datSubset <- read.csv("results/datSubset.csv")
```

## Estimate abundance for point count and detections for acoustic data  
Here, we make a distinction before running correlative analyses that abundance corresponds to the total number of individuals of a species detected across visits to a site and can only be calculated for point count data. In the acoustic dataset, individuals are not seen and a measure of detections (estimated as the total number of times as species was heard across ~576 10-s clips. Here 576 clips correspond to the total amount of acoustic data - 96 min (576 10-s clips) of data = 16-min of data for every visit).  
```{r}
# point-count data
# estimate total abundance across all species for each site
abundance <- datSubset %>%
  filter(data_type == "point_count") %>%
  group_by(site_id, restoration_type, scientific_name,
           common_name, eBird_codes) %>% 
  summarise(abundance_pc = sum(number)) %>%
  ungroup()

# estimate total number of detections across the acoustic data
# note: we cannot call this abundance as it refers to the total number of vocalizations across a 16-min period across all sites
detections <- datSubset %>%
  filter(data_type == "acoustic_data") %>%
  group_by(site_id, restoration_type, scientific_name,
           common_name, eBird_codes) %>% 
  summarise(detections_aru = sum(number)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

## Correlations between abundance and detections
```{r}
# create a single dataframe
data <- full_join(abundance, detections)%>%
  replace_na(list(abundance_pc = 0, detections_aru = 0))

# reordering factors for plotting
data$restoration_type <- factor(data$restoration_type, levels = c("BM", "AR", "NR"))

## Group data on abundance and detections across sites (at the level of the treatment type) for each species

```{r}
# grouping point count data at the level of the treatment type
abundance_group <- data %>%
  group_by(restoration_type, scientific_name,
           common_name, eBird_codes) %>%

## Species-specific plots of correlations between abundance and detections  

Note: We will not be grouping data by treatment types for plot as we have insufficient data if we divided it up.  
```{r}
plots <- list()

for(i in 1:length(unique(data$scientific_name))){
  
  # extract species scientific name
  a <- unique(data$scientific_name)[i]
  
  # subset data for plotting
  for_plot <- data[data$scientific_name==a,]
  
  # create plots
  plots[[i]] <- ggscatterstats(
  data = for_plot,
  x = detections_aru,
  y = abundance_pc,
  type = "r",
  title = a,
  ggplot.component = list(theme(text = element_text(family = "Century Gothic", size = 15, face = "bold"),plot.title = element_text(family = "Century Gothic",size = 18, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(family = "Century Gothic", 
      size = 15, face = "bold",color="#1b2838"),
      axis.title = element_text(family = "Century Gothic",
      size = 15, face = "bold"))))
}

# plot and save as a single pdf
cairo_pdf(
