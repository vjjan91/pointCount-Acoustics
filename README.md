This repository contains code and analysis for a manuscript that compares point count survey data to manually annotated acoustic data of tropical bird species across a gradient of forest regeneration in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot.  

This manuscript is currently in _progress_. Please reach out to the repository owner if you have questions.

### Source code for the analyses  

We describe what each script (`.Rmd`) of this repository is intended to achieve below.  

This project builds on two previously published manuscripts. The first manuscript (published in the [Journal of Applied Ecology](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.14052)) compared bird species richness and abundance across a gradient of forest regeneration for which data was collected via point count surveys. The second manuscript carried out a similar analysis using manual annotations of passive acoustic monitoring data (published in [Biological Conservation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320723001726). Please refer to this [link](https://vjjan91.github.io/acoustics-Restoration/) to view code and analysis for the second manuscript. The outputs from the previously written analyses are now added to the `data/` folder.
