# Abundance vs. vocalization rates

In this script, we model correlations between abundance (as estimated via point count data) and vocalization rates (calculated from acoustic data).

## Estimate abundance from point count data and calculate vocalization rates from acoustic data

Here, we make a distinction before running correlative analyses that abundance corresponds to the total number of individuals of a species detected across visits to a site and can only be calculated for point count data.

Unlike the previous script, where we used a measure of detections from the acoustic data, we will calculate a measure which we define as vocalization rates. Vocalization rate is calculated as the number of vocalizations (detections across 10-s clips) for a particular time period. Here, time period is defined as the number of total number of 10s-clips across the number of visits to that site. In other words, each site can have ~4 to 5 16-min acoustic surveys at that site.

The total number of acoustic detections for a single acoustic survey can range from 0 to 96, where 96 corresponds to the number of 10-s clips that were analyzed across the 16-min window. If there were 4 or 5 visits to a site, this number can range from 0 to (384/480) [in other words, 96x4 or 96x5].

Hence, the vocalization rate for each species at a site is defined as (x number of vocalizations)/(total number of 10-s clips analyzed). The total number of 10-s clips analyzed can vary depending on the number of visits to the site.

```{r}
# point-count data
# estimate total abundance of all species for each site
abundance <- datSubset %>%
  filter(data_type == "point_count") %>%
  group_by(site_id, restoration_type, scientific_name,
           common_name, eBird_codes) %>% 
  summarise(abundance_pc = sum(number)) %>%
  ungroup()

# for acoustic data, we will first estimate the number of visits to a site, which will essentially translate to the number of 10-s clips that were analyzed/heard (used here as the time period for the calculation of vocalization rates)

# nVisits is calculated here
# except for INBS04U, all other sites had a total of 5 visits, while INBS04U had 4 visits
nSitesDays <- datSubset %>%
  filter(data_type == "acoustic_data") %>%
  dplyr::select(site_id, date)%>%
  distinct() %>% arrange(site_id) %>% count(site_id) %>%
  rename(nVisits = n)

# estimate total number of detections across the acoustic data
# note: we cannot call this abundance as it refers to the total number of vocalizations across all sites
detections <- datSubset %>%
  filter(data_type == "acoustic_data") %>%
  group_by(site_id, restoration_type, scientific_name,
           common_name, eBird_codes) %>% 
  summarise(detections_aru = sum(number)) %>%
  ungroup()

# estimating vocalization rates for each species for each site
vocRate <- detections %>%
  left_join(., nSitesDays, by = "site_id") %>%
  mutate(nClips = nVisits*96) %>%
  mutate(vocRate = detections_aru/nClips)

# Note that the column vocRate can vary between 0 to 1 for each species for each site (this value can vary across sites for each species, referring to how vocally active a species is)
```

## Correlations between abundance and vocalization rates

# only those species that have a minimum abundance value of 10 and minimum detection value of 10
spp_subset <-  data %>%
  group_by(scientific_name) %>%
  summarise(abundance_pc = sum(abundance_pc), detections_aru = sum(detections_aru)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(abundance_pc >=10 & detections_aru >= 10)
