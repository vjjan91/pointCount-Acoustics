# Frequency  

In this script, we will explore relationships between the ratio of bird detections in a point count and acoustic survey and the median peak frequecy of a species. To do this, we will continue to rely on detections estimated at the site-level (similar to what was required for the indicator species analysis).   

To get at this measure, we estimate detections at the site level (for a total of six visits). If the across_visit_detections = 6, that means that a species was detected every single time across each of the six visits to that site. This value ranges from 1 to 6 for each species for a point count survey while ranging between 1 to 5 for each species for an acoustic survey. To account for the slight difference in the number of visits, we scale the data to go between 1 and 10 (arbitrarily chosen) to ensure that the visit-level estimates are comparable.

```

## Load species trait data and frequency data
```{r}
trait <- read.csv("data/species-trait-dat.csv")
freq <- read.csv("data/frequency-data.csv")
```

## Process frequency data  

We will extract the median peak frequency for each species. Note: For a total of 114 species, template recordings (varying from a minimum of 2 templates to 1910 templates per species) was extracted by Meghana P Srivathsa. While extracting median peak frequency, no distinction was made between songs and calls as our aim is understand which approach detected species more across visits.  
```{r}
# how many templates exist across species
# minimum templates = 2; maximum templates = 1910
nTemplates <- freq %>%
  group_by(eBird_codes) %>%
  count()

median_pf <- freq %>%
  group_by(eBird_codes) %>%
  summarise(median_peak_freq =  median(peak_freq_in_Hz))
```

## Visit-level detection estimates for each species  

We estimate the total number of detections of each species across all visits for point count data and acoustic surveys and scale them so that they are comparable.    
```{r}
## we will estimate abundance across point counts by site-date (essentially corresponding to visit)
abundance <- datSubset %>%
  filter(data_type == "point_count") %>%
  group_by(date, site_id, restoration_type, scientific_name,

  ungroup()

# scale values to go between 1 and 10
pc_visit_detections$pc_visit_scaled <- rescale(pc_visit_detections$pc_visit_detections, to = c(1,10))

# estimate total number of detections across the acoustic data by site-date (essentially corresponds to a visit)
# note: we cannot call this abundance as it refers to the total number of vocalizations across a 16-min period across all sites
detections <- datSubset %>%
  filter(data_type == "acoustic_data") %>%
  group_by(date, site_id, restoration_type, scientific_name,
           common_name, eBird_codes) %>% 
  summarise(totDetections = sum(number)) %>%
  ungroup()

# estimate across visit detections for acoustic data

  mutate(forDetections = case_when(totDetections > 0 ~ 1)) %>%

  ungroup()

# scale values to go between 1 and 10
aru_visit_detections$aru_visit_scaled <- rescale(aru_visit_detections$aru_visit_detections, to = c(1,10))
