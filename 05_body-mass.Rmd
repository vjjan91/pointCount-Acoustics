# Body mass

In this script, we will explore relationships between the ratio of bird detections in a point count and acoustic survey and the body mass of a species. To do this, we will continue to rely on detections estimated at the site-level (similar to what was required for the indicator species analysis).   

To get at this measure, we estimate detections at the site level (for a total of six visits). If the across_visit_detections = 6, that means that a species was detected every single time across each of the six visits to that site. This value ranges from 1 to 6 for each species for a point count and acoustic survey.

## Visit-level detection estimates for each species  

We estimate the total number of detections of each species across all visits. This can vary between 1 and 6 for point counts (since a total of six visits were made to each site), while this number can vary between 1 to 5 for acoustic surveys. To account for the slight difference in the number of visits, we scale the data to go between 0 and 1 to ensure that the visit-level estimates are comparable.       
```{r}
## we will estimate abundance across point counts by site-date (essentially corresponding to visit)
abundance <- datSubset %>%
  filter(data_type == "point_count") %>%
  group_by(date, site_id, restoration_type, scientific_name,

# estimate total number of detections across the acoustic data by site-date (essentially corresponds to a visit)
# note: we cannot call this abundance as it refers to the total number of vocalizations across a 16-min period across all sites

  group_by(date, site_id, restoration_type, scientific_name,
           common_name, eBird_codes) %>%

                  pc_visit_scaled = 0, aru_visit_scaled = 0))
  
# create column of ratio of detections of point counts to total number of detections from point count and acoustic data
# note: if there are no detections through the acoustic survey, the ratio will be 1; if there are equal number of detections in the acoustic survey and point count data, the ratio will be 0.5; if there no detections/lesser detections in a point count compared to acoustic survey, the ratio will be between 0 and 0.5; and lastly, if there are more detections in a point count compared to an acoustic survey, the ratio will be between 0.5 and 1. 

visit_detections <- visit_detections %>%

           (pc_visit_scaled + aru_visit_scaled))
