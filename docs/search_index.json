We apply a series of filters to ensure that we account for broader differences in sampling methodologies to ensure that they are comparable to one another. 2.1 Install required libraries library(tidyverse) library(dplyr) library(stringr) library(vegan) library(ggplot2) library(scico) library(data.table) library(extrafont) library(sf) library(raster) # for plotting library(scales) library(ggplot2) library(ggspatial) library(colorspace) # Source any custom/other internal functions necessary for analysis source(&quot;code/01_internal-functions.R&quot;) 2.2 Loading point count data # This is data from Hariharan and Raman (2021), which consists of point counts carried out across 69 sites point_counts &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/point-count-data.csv&quot;) # add eBird species code to the point-count data for comparison with acoustic data later on species_codes &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/species-annotation-codes.csv&quot;) # for the sake of comparability, some issues were fixed in the point-count dataset # please note that these issues were fixed using the .csv file and not through R # the following issues were fixed: # leading spaces were removed from the common_name # species that start with the common_name &#39;Grey&#39; were changed to &#39;Gray&#39; # merge with point_count data point_counts &lt;- left_join(point_counts, species_codes, by = &quot;common_name&quot;) # removing all mammal species and unidentified bird species point_counts &lt;- point_counts %&gt;% filter(bird_mammal == &quot;Bird&quot;) 2.3 Loading the acoustic data The acoustic data consists of annotations of 10-s chunks of audio files across summer and winter months. We will load both these annotation sets and process them further to ensure that it is comparable to the point count dataset. # Attach the annotation data for summer and winter # These two .csvs below are not uploaded to GitHub and can be provided upon request # Please write to Vijay Ramesh if you would like to access the raw data - vr292@cornell.edu) summer_data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/summer-dawn-annotations.csv&quot;) winter_data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/winter-dawn-annotations.csv&quot;) # combine the datasets to a single dataframe acoustic_data &lt;- bind_rows(summer_data, winter_data) names(acoustic_data) # reorder columns to ensure the species codes appear one after another # also include species that are present in point count data to later combine both dataframes together acoustic_data &lt;- acoustic_data %&gt;% relocate(c(&quot;BFOW&quot;, &quot;SBEO&quot;, &quot;JUNI&quot;, &quot;ASKO&quot;, &quot;HSWO&quot;, &quot;TBWA&quot;), .after = &quot;CORO&quot;) # split the filename column into 4 columns : Site, Date, Time and Splits acoustic_data &lt;- separate(acoustic_data, col = Filename, into = c(&quot;site&quot;, &quot;date&quot;, &quot;time&quot;, &quot;splits&quot;), sep = &quot;_&quot;) 2.4 Subset acoustic data and point count data To ensure that the datasets are comparable, we carry out the following: Subset only data from those sites for which both point count data and acoustic data was collected. Ensure that the dates of visits (for both point count data and acoustic data) are coming from the same season/months. It is important to clarify that while the point count data and acoustic data were collected across similar months (to match seasons), majority of the point count data were collected between November 2019 and March 2020, while the majority of the acoustic data were collected in March 2020, a few days in May 2020 (covid-19 related delays) and between December 2020 and January 2021. To ensure that the point count data and acoustic data are comparable, we exclude data from May 2020 (for the acoustic dataset) and because bird communities are often depauperate at this time (majority of the migratory bird species have departed to their breeding grounds). Similar levels of effort across sites (for point count data and acoustic data). Here, we define effort as the total number of minutes a site was surveyed. The duration of each point count at a site was 15 minutes long while the duration of each acoustic survey at a site was 16 minutes in duration. For the sake of comparability, we can include upto 6 point counts to each site, while including 5 acoustic ‘visits’ to each site. This results in a total of 90 minutes of effort at each site for point count data, while resulting in a total of 80 minutes of effort at each site for the acoustic data. # a subset of sites that were included in the Hariharan and Raman (2021) study were included in the Ramesh et al.

For the acoustic data, this column indicates the number of vocalizations of a species within a time segment (str: Integer) distance: For the point count data, this column indicates the distance at which an individual of a species was observed (seen) within a time segment. This number varied from 0 to 50 metres and all individuals/species above that distance was not reported in the point count dataset.

For example, if the start time of the point count was ‘7.42’, this column would indicate the timeOfDay as ‘7AM to 8AM’. Similarly, if the start time of the acoustic survey was ‘091000’, this column would indicated the timeOfDay as ‘9AM to 10AM’ (str: Character) dataType: Point count or acoustic data (str: Character) "],["richness-estimates.html", "Section 3 Richness estimates 3.1 Install necessary libraries 3.2 Load dataframe containing point count and acoustic data 3.3 Load species trait data 3.4 Estimate richness for point count and acoustic data 3.5 Visualize differences in richness between point count data and acoustic data 3.6 Visualize differences in richness as a function of species habitat affiliation 3.7 Visualize differences in species richness as a function of species foraging guilds 3.8 Stacked barplots for richness across foraging guilds", " Section 3 Richness estimates In this script, we will calculate species richness estimates across point count surveys and acoustic data.

If the aim is to determine which species can be used as indicators of certain site group, an approach commonly used in ecology is the Indicator Value (Dufrene and Legendre, 1997). These authors defined an Indicator Value (IndVal) index to measure the association between a species and a site group. The method of Dufrene and Legendre (1997) calculates the IndVal index between the species and each site group and then looks for the group corresponding to the highest association value. Finally, the statistical significance of this relationship is tested using a permutation test. Diagnostic (or indicator) species are an important tool in vegetation science, because these species can be used to characterize and indicate specific plant community types. A statistic commonly used to determine the association (also known as fidelity, not to be confounded with the indicator value component) between species and vegetation types is Pearson’s phi coefficient of association (Chytry et al., 2002). This coefficient is a measure of the correlation between two binary vectors. The abundance-based counterpart of the phi coefficient is called the point biserial correlation coefficient (which is defined as “r.g”).

To do this, we will continue to rely on detections estimated at the site-level (similar to what was required for the indicator species analysis). To get at this measure, we estimate detections at the site level (for a total of six visits). If the across_visit_detections = 6, that means that a species was detected every single time across each of the six visits to that site. This value ranges from 1 to 6 for each species for a point count survey while ranging between 1 to 5 for each species for an acoustic survey.

However, when we break this result down and examine it for each species by species, we notice that the above result varies by species. At the species level, we considered a total of 48 species for this exercise. The list of 48 species only includes those that had a minimum abundance value of 10 and a minimum number of acoustic detections of 10. We observed that ~15 species showed a positive r of &gt;0.4, ~20 species showed a positive r of &gt;0.3.Nine species showed a very small positive r value between 0 and 0.2. The species that showed the highest positive r values include Pycnonotus jocosus (0.85), Hypsipetes ganeesa (0.67) and Leptocoma minima (0.66). Five species had a negative r value between 0 and -0.2. Seven species had a negative r value that ranged between -0.2 and -0.51. The three species showing a very high negative r value are Dicrurus aeneus (-0.51), Muscicapa muttui(-0.46), and Ficedula ruficauda (-0.45). 9.8 Regressions between abundance and detections While it is relevant to examine correlations between abundance (as estimated from point count data) and detections (as estimated from acoustic data), we will run robust regressions to ask one predicts the other. ## We use the dat_subset dataframe moving forward, as it contains the subset of species with a minimum of 10 abundance values and 10 acoustic detections across sites and visits ## I am borrowing code from Mikula et al. 2020 below ## The data and scripts from their manuscript can be found here: ## https://osf.io/fa9ky/ dat_subset &lt;- setDT(dat_subset) # extract t-value dat_subset[, t_value := summary(lm(detections_aru ~ abundance_pc))$coefficients[6], by = scientific_name] # extract slope dat_subset[, slope := lm(detections_aru ~ abundance_pc)%&gt;% coef()%&gt;% nth(2), by = scientific_name] # extract pearson&#39;s correlation dat_subset[, pearson := cor(detections_aru, abundance_pc), by = scientific_name] # extract adjusted r squared dat_subset[, r_sq := summary(lm(detections_aru ~ abundance_pc))$adj.r.squared, by = scientific_name] # create a column with the direction of the slope (whether it is positive or negative), which can be referred to later while plotting dat_subset[, slope_dir := ifelse(slope &gt;0, &#39;+&#39;, &#39;-&#39;)] paste(&quot;Positive regressions:&quot;,length(unique(dat_subset$scientific_name[dat_subset$slope_dir %in% c(&#39;+&#39;)]))) # 39 species had a positive regression/slope value ## visualization fig_abund_detec_reg &lt;- ggplot(dat_subset, aes(y = detections_aru, x = abundance_pc)) + geom_point(color = &quot;#9CC3D5&quot;,size = 1.2) + geom_smooth(data = dat_subset, aes(group = scientific_name, color = slope_dir), method = &#39;lm&#39;, se = FALSE, linewidth = 0.7) + scale_color_manual(values=c(&quot;#1B9E77&quot;, &quot;#D95F02&quot;)) + labs(y=&quot;\\nDetections (from acoustic data)&quot;, x=&quot;Abundance (from point count data)\\n&quot;) + theme_bw() + annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x=13, y=400, label= &quot;Slope:&quot;, col = &quot;grey30&quot;, size = 12) + annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x=16, y=400, label= &quot;+&quot;, col = &quot;#D95F02&quot;, size = 12) + annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 18, y=400, label = &quot;-&quot;, col = &quot;#1B9E77&quot;, size = 12)+ theme(text = element_text(family = &quot;Century Gothic&quot;, size = 18, face = &quot;bold&quot;),plot.title = element_text(family = &quot;Century Gothic&quot;, size = 18, face = &quot;bold&quot;), plot.subtitle = element_text(family = &quot;Century Gothic&quot;, size = 15, face = &quot;bold&quot;,color=&quot;#1b2838&quot;), axis.title = element_text(family = &quot;Century Gothic&quot;, size = 18, face = &quot;bold&quot;), legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) ggsave(fig_abund_detec_reg, filename = &quot;figs/fig_abundance_vs_detections_regressions_allSpecies.png&quot;, width = 14, height = 16, device = png(), units = &quot;in&quot;, dpi = 300) dev.off() # extract the slope, t_value, pearson correlation and the adjusted r square lm_output &lt;- dat_subset %&gt;% dplyr::select(scientific_name, t_value, slope, pearson, slope_dir,r_sq) %&gt;% distinct() # write the values to file write.csv(lm_output, &quot;results/abundance-detections-regressions.csv&quot;, row.names = F) Of the 48 species for which acoustic detections were regressed with abundance (from point count data), 39 species showed a positive slope. 9.9 Plotting species-specific regression plots # visualization plots &lt;- list() for(i in 1:length(unique(dat_subset$scientific_name))){ # extract species scientific name a &lt;- unique(dat_subset$scientific_name)[i] # subset data for plotting for_plot &lt;- dat_subset[dat_subset$scientific_name==a,] # create plots plots[[i]] &lt;- ggplot(for_plot, aes(y = detections_aru, x = abundance_pc)) + geom_point(color = &quot;#9CC3D5&quot;,size = 1.2) + geom_smooth(aes(color = &quot;#D95F02&quot;), method = &#39;lm&#39;, se = TRUE, linewidth = 0.7) + labs(title = paste0(a,&quot;

Unlike the previous script, where we used a measure of detections from the acoustic data, we will calculate a measure which we define as vocalization rates. Vocalization rate is calculated as the number of vocalizations (detections across 10-s clips) for a particular time period. Here, time period is defined as the number of total number of 10s-clips across the number of visits to that site. In other words, each site can have ~4 to 5 16-min acoustic surveys at that site. The total number of acoustic detections for a single acoustic survey can range from 0 to 96, where 96 corresponds to the number of 10-s clips that were analyzed across the 16-min window. If there were 4 or 5 visits to a site, this number can range from 0 to (384/480) [in other words, 96x4 or 96x5]. Hence, the vocalization rate for each species at a site is defined as (x number of vocalizations)/(total number of 10-s clips analyzed). The total number of 10-s clips analyzed can vary depending on the number of visits to the site. # point-count data # estimate total abundance of all species for each site abundance &lt;- datSubset %&gt;% filter(data_type == &quot;point_count&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(site_id, restoration_type, scientific_name, common_name, eBird_codes) %&gt;% summarise(abundance_pc = sum(number)) %&gt;% ungroup() # for acoustic data, we will first estimate the number of visits to a site, which will essentially translate to the number of 10-s clips that were analyzed/heard (used here as the time period for the calculation of vocalization rates) # nVisits is calculated here # except for INBS04U, all other sites had a total of 5 visits, while INBS04U had 4 visits nSitesDays &lt;- datSubset %&gt;% filter(data_type == &quot;acoustic_data&quot;) %&gt;% dplyr::select(site_id, date)%&gt;% distinct() %&gt;% arrange(site_id) %&gt;% count(site_id) %&gt;% rename(nVisits = n) # estimate total number of detections across the acoustic data # note: we cannot call this abundance as it refers to the total number of vocalizations across all sites detections &lt;- datSubset %&gt;% filter(data_type == &quot;acoustic_data&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(site_id, restoration_type, scientific_name, common_name, eBird_codes) %&gt;% summarise(detections_aru = sum(number)) %&gt;% ungroup() # estimating vocalization rates for each species for each site vocRate &lt;- detections %&gt;% left_join(., nSitesDays, by = &quot;site_id&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(nClips = nVisits*96) %&gt;% mutate(vocRate = detections_aru/nClips) # Note that the column vocRate can vary between 0 to 1 for each species for each site (this value can vary across sites for each species, referring to how vocally active a species is) 10.4 Correlations between abundance and vocalization rates # create a single dataframe data &lt;- full_join(abundance, vocRate)%&gt;% replace_na(list(abundance_pc = 0, detections_aru = 0, nVisits = 0, nClips = 0, vocRate = 0)) # only those species that have a minimum abundance value of 10 and minimum detection value of 10 spp_subset &lt;- data %&gt;% group_by(scientific_name) %&gt;% summarise(abundance_pc = sum(abundance_pc), detections_aru = sum(detections_aru)) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% filter(abundance_pc &gt;=10 &amp; detections_aru &gt;= 10) # subset data data &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(scientific_name %in% spp_subset$scientific_name) # reordering factors for plotting data$restoration_type &lt;- factor(data$restoration_type, levels = c(&quot;BM&quot;, &quot;AR&quot;, &quot;NR&quot;)) # visualization fig_abund_vocRate_cor &lt;- grouped_ggscatterstats( data = data, x = vocRate, y = abundance_pc, grouping.var = restoration_type, type = &quot;r&quot;, plotgrid.args = list(nrow = 3, ncol = 1), ggplot.component = list(theme(text = element_text(family = &quot;Century Gothic&quot;, size = 15, face = &quot;bold&quot;),plot.title = element_text(family = &quot;Century Gothic&quot;, size = 18, face = &quot;bold&quot;), plot.subtitle = element_text(family = &quot;Century Gothic&quot;, size = 15, face = &quot;bold&quot;,color=&quot;#1b2838&quot;), axis.title = element_text(family = &quot;Century Gothic&quot;, size = 15, face = &quot;bold&quot;)))) ggsave(fig_abund_vocRate_cor, filename = &quot;figs/fig_abundance_vs_vocRates_correlations.png&quot;, width = 14, height = 16, device = png(), units = &quot;in&quot;, dpi = 300) dev.off() Positive correlations were observed between abundance (estimated through point count data) and vocalization rates (estimated through acoustic data) across treatment types.

Here 576 clips correspond to the total amount of acoustic data - 96 min (576 10-s clips) of data = 16-min of data for every visit). # point-count data # estimate total abundance across all species for each site abundance &lt;- datSubset %&gt;% filter(data_type == &quot;point_count&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(site_id, scientific_name) %&gt;% summarise(abundance_pc = sum(number)) %&gt;% ungroup() # estimate total number of detections across the acoustic data # note: we cannot call this abundance as it refers to the total number of vocalizations across all sites detections &lt;- datSubset %&gt;% filter(data_type == &quot;acoustic_data&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(site_id, scientific_name) %&gt;% summarise(detections_aru = sum(number)) %&gt;% ungroup() 11.4 Create rank abundance curves ## preparing the point count data for the creation of rank abundance curves pc_rank &lt;- abundance %&gt;% group_by(site_id) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = scientific_name, values_from = abundance_pc, values_fill = list(abundance_pc=0)) %&gt;% ungroup() pc_rank_mat &lt;- as.matrix(pc_rank[, 2:ncol(pc_rank)]) png(filename = &quot;figs/fig_pointCount_rankCurve.png&quot;, width = 12, height = 10, units = &quot;in&quot;, res = 300) pc_rank_curve &lt;- racurve(pc_rank_mat, nlab = 10, main = &quot;Rank-abundance curve for point count data&quot;, ylim = c(0,0.12)) dev.off() ## preparing the acoustic data for the creation of rank abundance curves aru_rank &lt;- detections %&gt;% group_by(site_id) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = scientific_name, values_from = detections_aru, values_fill = list(detections_aru=0)) %&gt;% ungroup() aru_rank_mat &lt;- as.matrix(aru_rank[, 2:ncol(aru_rank)]) png(filename = &quot;figs/fig_acoustic_rankCurve.png&quot;, width = 12, height = 10, units = &quot;in&quot;, res = 300) aru_rank_curve &lt;- racurve(aru_rank_mat, nlab = 10, main = &quot;Rank-abundance curve for acoustic data&quot;, ylim = c(0,0.12)) dev.off() Rank-abundance curve for point count data uses abundance data. The top ten species (based on their ranks) are indicated in this figure. Rank-abundance curve for acoustic data uses acoustic detections. The top ten species (based on their ranks) are indicated in this figure. Based on the above two figures, we observe that the species that made up the top ten ranks are similar across methods, except the ranks are different. 11.5 Rank-abundance models Here, we fit brokenstick, preemption, log-Normal, Zipf and Zipf-Mandelbrot models of species abundance to ask if the data on abundance (from point count data) takes on a similar model of rank-abundance as data from acoustic surveys. pc_model&lt;- radfit(pc_rank_mat) aru_model &lt;- radfit(aru_rank_mat) png(filename = &quot;figs/fig_pointCount_rankModel.png&quot;, width = 12, height = 10, units = &quot;in&quot;, res = 300) plot(pc_model) dev.off() png(filename = &quot;figs/fig_acousticData_rankModel.png&quot;, width = 12, height = 10, units = &quot;in&quot;, res = 300) plot(aru_model) dev.off() Rank-abundance models across sites for point count data. Rank-abundance models across sites for acoustic data. vegan has five models, each with characteristic rank-abundance curve shapes: • Pre-emption (geometric series) • Broken stick • Log-normal • Mandelbrot (also called Zipf-Mandelbrot) • Zipf These and other rank-abundance models fall into two camps: one group is based on assumptions of niche partitioning and competition that limits species’ abundances, and the other is based on the statistical behavior of large samples. The results suggests that across sites for both point count and acoustic data, majority of the data follow a preemption model (essentially, a geometric series). For more details regarding the models, please see this useful resource: https://myweb.ttu.edu/nmcintyr/Community%20Ecology/abundance.docx (this link will take you a word document that was written by Dr. Nancy McIntyre -http://myweb.ttu.edu/nmcintyr/). The big takeway from running these rank abundance models are that majority of the sites seem to show a similar distribution of data across the approaches. 11.6 Species accumulation curves pc_accum &lt;- specaccum(pc_rank_mat) aru_accum &lt;- specaccum(aru_rank_mat) png(filename = &quot;figs/fig_specAccumCurves.png&quot;, width = 12, height = 10, units = &quot;in&quot;, res = 300) plot(aru_accum, ci.type = &quot;poly&quot;, col = &quot;darkgreen&quot;, lwd=2, ci.lty=0, ci.col=&quot;lightgreen&quot;, ylim = c(0,120), ylab = &quot;Exact method of species accumulation&quot;, xlab = &quot;Number of sites&quot;, main = &quot;Species accummulation curves for acoustic data (green) and point count data (blue)&quot;) plot(pc_accum, ci.type=&quot;poly&quot;, col=&quot;blue&quot;, lwd=2, ci.lty=0, ci.col=&quot;lightblue&quot;, add= TRUE) dev.off() Species accumulation curves for acoustic data and point count data "],["r-value-vs.-species-traits.html", "Section 12 r value vs. species traits 12.1 Load necessary libraries 12.2 Load species trait data and frequency data 12.3 Load correlation scores from previous script 12.4 Body mass and correlation scores", " Section 12 r value vs. species traits In this script, we will plot the correlation scores (derived from the abundance vs. detections script) against species-specific traits to test if the strength of correlation varies as a function of species traits. 12.1 Load necessary libraries library(tidyverse) library(dplyr) library(stringr) library(vegan) library(ggplot2) library(scico) library(psych) library(ecodist) library(RColorBrewer) library(ggforce) library(ggpubr) library(ggalt) library(patchwork) library(sjPlot) library(ggside) library(ggstatsplot) library(extrafont) #
