If the aim is to determine which species can be used as indicators of certain site group, an approach commonly used in ecology is the Indicator Value (Dufrene and Legendre, 1997). These authors defined an Indicator Value (IndVal) index to measure the association between a species and a site group. The method of Dufrene and Legendre (1997) calculates the IndVal index between the species and each site group and then looks for the group corresponding to the highest association value. Finally, the statistical significance of this relationship is tested using a permutation test. Diagnostic (or indicator) species are an important tool in vegetation science, because these species can be used to characterize and indicate specific plant community types. A statistic commonly used to determine the association (also known as fidelity, not to be confounded with the indicator value component) between species and vegetation types is Pearson’s phi coefficient of association (Chytry et al., 2002). This coefficient is a measure of the correlation between two binary vectors. The abundance-based counterpart of the phi coefficient is called the point biserial correlation coefficient (which is defined as “r.g”).
