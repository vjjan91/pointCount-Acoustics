# Richness estimates  

In this script, we will calculate species richness estimates across point count surveys and acoustic data. We estimate differences in species richness by habitat affiliation and foraging guilds.   

## Install necessary libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(vegan)
library(ggplot2)
library(scico)
library(data.table)
library(extrafont)
library(ggstatsplot)

# Source any custom/other internal functions necessary for analysis
source("code/01_internal-functions.R")
```

## Load dataframe containing point count and acoustic data
```{r}
datSubset <- read.csv("results/datSubset.csv")
```

## Load species trait data
```{r}
trait <- read.csv("data/species-trait-dat.csv")

# add it to the subset data
datSubset <- left_join(datSubset,trait[,c(1,7,8)], by = "scientific_name")
```

## Estimate richness for point count and acoustic data
```{r}
# point-count data
# estimate total abundance across all species for each site
abundance <- datSubset %>%
  filter(data_type == "point_count") %>%
  group_by(site_id, scientific_name,
           common_name, eBird_codes, habitat, foraging_habit) %>% summarise(totAbundance = sum(number)) %>%
  ungroup()

# total abundance by species
pc_totAbundance <- abundance %>%
  group_by(scientific_name, common_name, habitat, foraging_habit) %>%
  summarise(totAbundance = sum(totAbundance))

# species most abundant in a point count include the Nilgiri flowerpecker, Greenish Warbler, White-cheeked Barbet, Yellow-browed Bulbul, Vernal-hanging Parrot

# estimate richness for point count data (calculated for each site)
pc_richness <- abundance %>%

  ungroup()

# estimate total number of detections across the acoustic data
# note: we cannot call this abundance as it refers to the total number of vocalizations across a 15-min period across all sites
detections <- datSubset %>%
  filter(data_type == "acoustic_data") %>%
  group_by(site_id, scientific_name,
           common_name, eBird_codes, habitat, foraging_habit) %>% summarise(totDetections = sum(number)) %>%
  ungroup()

# total number of detections by species
aru_totDetections <- detections %>%
  group_by(scientific_name, common_name, habitat, foraging_habit) %>%
  summarise(totDetections = sum(totDetections))

# species with the highest numbers of acoustic detections across sites are the White-cheeked Barbet, Crimson-backed Sunbird, Nilgiri Flowerpecker, Red-whiskered Bulbul and Greenish Warbler
  
# estimate richness for acoustic data
aru_richness <- detections %>%
  mutate(forRichness = case_when(totDetections > 0 ~ 1)) %>%
  group_by(site_id) %>%
  summarise(richness = sum(forRichness)) %>%
  mutate(data_type = "acoustic_data") %>%
  ungroup()

# how many species were detected in a point count but not acoustic data?
# four species were detected that were not observed in acoustic surveys
pc_not_aru <- anti_join(pc_totAbundance, aru_totDetections)
write.csv(pc_not_aru, "results/species-in-pointCount-not-acoustics.csv", row.names = F)

# how many species were detected in acoustic data but not point counts?
# 31 species were detected in acoustic data, but not in point counts
aru_not_pc <- anti_join(aru_totDetections, pc_totAbundance)
write.csv(aru_not_pc, "results/species-in-acoustics-not-pointCounts.csv", row.names = F)
