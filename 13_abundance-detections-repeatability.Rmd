# Abundance and detections repeatability analyses  

In this script, we will subsample data from the point count and acoustic dataset and test if the abundance and acoustic detections are repeatable across seasons.

## Estimate abundance for point count data and detections for acoustic data  

Here, we make a distinction before running correlative analyses that abundance corresponds to the total number of individuals of a species detected across visits to a site and can only be calculated for point count data. In the acoustic dataset, individuals are not seen and a measure of detections (estimated as the total number of times as species was heard across ~576 10-s clips). Here 576 clips correspond to the total amount of acoustic data - 96 min (576 10-s clips) of data = 16-min of data for every visit). Here, we also add a vist_number column to each object to ease subsampling of data.    
```{r}
# point-count data
# estimate total abundance across all species for each site
# include a vist_number column to sub sample data later on
abundance <- datSubset %>%
  filter(data_type == "point_count") %>%
  group_by(site_id, restoration_type, scientific_name,
           common_name, eBird_codes, date) %>% 
  summarise(abundance_pc = sum(number)) %>%
  mutate(visit_number = row_number()) %>%
  ungroup()

# estimate total number of detections across the acoustic data
# note: we cannot call this abundance as it refers to the total number of vocalizations across all sites
# include a vist_number column to sub sample data later on
detections <- datSubset %>%
  filter(data_type == "acoustic_data") %>%
  group_by(site_id, restoration_type, scientific_name,
           common_name, eBird_codes, date) %>% 
  summarise(detections_aru = sum(number)) %>%
  mutate(visit_number = row_number()) %>%
  ungroup()

# note: we have six visits to each site for point count data but only a maximum of five visits per site for acoustic detections data 
```

## Run analysis at the level of each species (across all sites and treatments combined) for point count data  

Here we run analyses separately for point count data and acoustic data. First, we will filter data by visits (choosing the 1st, 3rd and 5th visit) to a site and calculate total abundance for each species. We will repeat the above by choosing the 2nd, 4th, and 6th visit to a site and calculate total abundance for each species. 
```{r}
# grouping point count data
# 1st, 3rd, and 5th visit
abundance_groupA <- abundance %>%
  filter(visit_number %in% c(1,3,5)) %>%
  group_by(scientific_name,
           common_name, eBird_codes) %>% 
  summarise(abundance_groupA = sum(abundance_pc)) %>%
  ungroup()

# 2nd, 4th, and 6th visit
abundance_groupB <- abundance %>%
  filter(visit_number %in% c(2,4,6)) %>%
  group_by(scientific_name,
           common_name, eBird_codes) %>% 
  summarise(abundance_groupB = sum(abundance_pc)) %>%
  ungroup()

# create a single dataframe
abund_data_group <- full_join(abundance_groupA, abundance_groupB) %>%
  replace_na(list(abundance_groupA = 0, abundance_groupB = 0)) 

# visualization

## Run analysis at the level of each species (across all sites and treatments combined) for acoustic data

First, we will filter data by visits (choosing the 1st, 3rd, and 5th visit) to a site and calculate total detections for each species. We will repeat the above by choosing the 2nd, and 4th visit to a site and calculate total detections for each species. We make a note that we do not have sufficient number of visits to equally divide/subsample them for acoustic data. 
```{r}
# grouping acoustic data
# 1st, 3rd, and 5th visit
detections_groupA <- detections %>%
  filter(visit_number %in% c(1,3,5)) %>%

## Mix and match acoustic data and point count surveys
